# Capstone_Project_Catch
Final Project for the Android Fundamentals Nanodegree

This applcation is an effective Task Manager that ranks your tasks in order of priority in categories. 

These tasks are represented by balloons that slowly fall down at a rate determined by their priority. 
Upon getting to the bottom of your screen, these balloons will pop and notify you that you have failed to complete your task on time.

This app should install cleanly through Android Studio, and was meant as an exercise in Android Development Fundamentals.
